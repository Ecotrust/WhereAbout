By activating this account you agree to participate under the following conditions:
The Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) is a state law directing the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) to design and manage an improved network of marine protected areas off California’s coast. To implement this law, a public-private partnership has been formed between the California Resources Agency, CDFG, and Resources Legacy Fund Foundation—the MLPA Initiative. As part of this effort, Ecotrust has been retained to collect, compile and analyze information pertaining to recreational fisheries along the northern California coast. The project is designed to provide spatially explicit information to the MLPA Initiative and the information collected in this project will improve upon what is currently available regarding recreational fisheries. 

The goal of the Recreational Fisheries Uses Project is to characterize recreational fishing areas of relative importance and recreational fishing use patterns along the northern California coast, using the expert knowledge of fishermen themselves. The purpose of this project is twofold:

1.  Develop accurate maps of the local recreational fishing grounds and characterize their relative importance to recreational fishermen; and
2.  Incorporate recreational fishermen’s knowledge into the deliberations of the Regional Stakeholder Group in the MLPA North Coast Study Region.

This kind of spatially explicit information on recreational fisheries will ensure representation of recreational values in the design, implementation and management of marine protected areas. 

During the summer and early fall 2009, Ecotrust personnel will be contacting recreational fishermen along the northern California coast to be interviewed. The format will be on-line, with follow-up meetings by user group in which the information collected will be validated by fishermen. Due to the sensitive nature of the information, only Ecotrust staff (operating under a strict confidentiality protocol) will handle the raw data generated during the interviews. All information collected in the interviews is anonymous and confidential on the individual level. All analyses and results will be presented only in aggregate form. The information will be used to create a comprehensive profile of the recreational fishing use patterns and values along California’s north coast, and may also be written up in a peer-reviewed journal. If appropriate, there may be the opportunity for release of aggregated study results for uses other than the MLPA process, but in line with the purposes of this research; however, your individual results will never be included in any release of aggregated results without your explicit consent. 

Your willingness to participate is not only appreciated, but indeed vital to the success of this project.  If you have any questions or concerns, contact Jon Bonkoski at jbonkoski@ecotrust.org 503.467.0804 or Leanne Weiss at lweiss@ecotrust.org 503.467.0809. The project website is www.ecotrust.org/mlpa
