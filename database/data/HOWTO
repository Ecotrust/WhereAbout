HOW TO PUT A NEW CLIP REGION INTO PLACE ON A PRODUCTION SERVER:

    (test this out on your dev server first)
    - create a copy of the sql file holding your clip region, call it foo.sql
    - edit that file and search/replace gwst_clip_region with foo
    - load foo into your database, cat foo.sql | psql -d or-rec-survey
    - copy the geometry from foo to gwst_region_clip table
    update gwst_region_clip set geom = a.geom from foo a where a.id=1;
    - Test the app

HOW TO ADD A SHAPEFILE TO A SPATIALITE DATABASE:

    Spatialite:
    spatialite.exe database/db.sqlite < database/data/fake-or-coast.sql

    database/data/fake-or-coast.sql:
    spatialite.exe database/db.sqlite
        --Opens spatialite command prompt with db.sqlite as the db
    .loadshp database/data/fake-or-coast foo CP1252 3310    
        # where 
            fake-or-coast is a shapefile (do NOT give filetype, such as ".shp"), 
            foo is the new table that is created, 
            cp1252 is the string type (standard Latin, a safe choice), 
            3310 is srid

    (continued from above)
    insert into gwst_region_clip (name, geom)
    select name, Geometry from foo;
